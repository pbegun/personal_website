		<p>Here are descriptions of some computer science projects I've worked on in the past couple of years, both in school and independently:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				A C++ program that finds the highest-scoring Scrabble word possible, given seven letter tiles (including up to one blank tile):
				<a href=Projects/scrabble.cpp target=_blank>scrabble.cpp</a>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				A C++ program that simulates the stock market: <a href=Projects/market.cpp target=_blank>market.cpp</a> &nbsp;
				<a href=Projects/market.h target=_blank>market.h</a>
				<br>
				<u>Note</u>: A much more detailed description of this project can be found in the comments at the top of market.cpp. Also, there are eight other files
				that contain code needed to make this program run, not including file with the driver. I've attached only these two files for the sake of brevity.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				A Prolog program to solve the following logic puzzle, using database queries: <a href=Projects/FarmerPuzzle.txt target=_blank>FarmerPuzzleSolution</a>
				<p>A farmer must ferry a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river using a boat that is too small to take more than one of three across
				at once. If he leaves the wolf and the goat together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the cabbage, the goat
				will eat the cabbage. How can he get all three across the river safely?</p>
			</li>
