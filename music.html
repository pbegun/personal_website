				Music is very important to me; I especially love listening to classic rock from the 60's and 70's while I'm coding. My favorite band
				is The Who, but I also enjoy listening to The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and many more.
				Tell me your favorites! I'm always open to new music.

				I have been playing guitar for about five and a half years. I've wanted to play piano for a while, so during Summer 2017, I decided to teach myself to 
				play piano by transposing guitar chords to the piano. It took a lot of practice, but I'm halfway decent at playing the piano now 
				(although I still make a lot of mistakes, and I can only play Beatles songs). Here are some of my favorite songs to play (pardon my dog barking in the background):
