		<p>I firmly believe that happiness is a warm puppy. Some of my earliest memories include watching <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> religiously and continually
		asking my mom if I can go on the Internet to find pictures of dogs to print and color in. While these particular activities no longer interest me, I still
		think dogs are just about the greatest thing on the planet. Here are my two favorites:</p>
		
		<div class=homer>
			<h2>HOMER</h2>
		
			<div class=homer_descr>
				<p>Homer is an eight-year-old Egyptian Pharaoh Hound. He's quirky, to say the least: Pharaoh Hounds are unique in that they "talk", and Homer is no exception
				to this (see video to the right). He's very strong-willed, and feels the need to share all of his opinions with anyone who will listen. He is the only dog
				I've ever heard of that can accurately be described as "bossy." Although this quickly becomes annoying, there is a positive side: it always feels like
				Homer is really trying to communicate with you. Overall, Homer is a sweet dog who enjoys eating, laying in the sun, and snuggling with his sister Daisy
				(although he would never admit it).</p>

		<div class=daisy_title>
			<h2>DAISY</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class=daisy>
			<div class=daisy_descr>
				<p>Daisy is a four-year-old Whippet. Her primary joy in life is sleep: she especially loves to sleep in a bed, and has recently discovered that the best way
				to do this is to go completely under the covers, and then poke her head out so that her shoulders are under the covers and her head is on a pillow (see left).
				Daisy loves treats, soft blankets, and her brother Homer (who merely tolerates her).</p>
